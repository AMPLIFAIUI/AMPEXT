**AMPIQ Launches AMP – The World’s First Middleware for Infinite Context AI**

SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA – AMPiQ. Australia today unveiled AMP: Auto Memory Persistence – the world’s first production-grade middleware for unlimited AI memory.

Unlike traditional token-limited chat systems, AMP embeds contextual memory directly into the browser DOM or backend middleware, giving AI the ability to "remember" across hours, days, or even weeks — with zero token cost.

AMP enables any LLM interface, browser-based or backend-integrated, to simulate infinite context with secure summarization, embedded memory blocks, and a 9-slot lifecycle engine.
