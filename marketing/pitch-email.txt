Subject: Unlock Unlimited Memory for Your AI Product — Meet AMP

Hi [Recipient Name],

I'm reaching out from AMPiQ. Australia to introduce **AMP** — a plug-and-play middleware that makes **any AI chat interface infinitely contextual**.

Unlike token-limited memory hacks, AMP silently embeds compressed memory into the DOM or backend vault, enabling your LLM to recall entire past conversations instantly — with zero cloud sync or token overhead.

If you run an AI startup, LLM dashboard, or chat assistant tool — AMP upgrades your memory layer in hours, not months.

We're currently onboarding select partners with early access licensing.

Interested in a quick demo?

Best,
