🚨 IMPORTANT BUILD NOTICE 🚨

The Electron build is currently BLOCKED by a locked file:
📁 desktop-ui/build/win-unpacked/resources/app.asar

🔒 LOCKED BY: VS Code Insiders process

TO FIX AND BUILD THE GUI EXE:
1. ✋ Close VS Code Insiders completely 
2. 🗑️ Delete the entire "build" folder in desktop-ui/
3. 🗑️ Delete the entire "dist" folder in desktop-ui/ (if it exists)
4. 🔄 Run: npm run build
5. ✅ Fresh GUI exe will be created without conflicts

ALTERNATIVE: If VS Code Insiders is needed, you can:
- Use regular VS Code instead
- Or restart VS Code Insiders after cleaning the build folders

Once the build completes successfully, you'll find the installer at:
📦 desktop-ui/build/AMPiQ Setup 2.0.0.exe

Date created: July 21, 2025
Status: Waiting for VS Code Insiders to release file lock
